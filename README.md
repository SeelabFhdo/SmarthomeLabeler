## SmarthomeLabeler
 This is a simple Java-FX Tool to create QR-Code labels containing information of your Eclipse-Smarthome items. 
 Please insert your ESH base URL like `http://foo:8080` and fetch the items. Later you can select multiple rows in the table and generate the QR-Codes as a PDF file. The PDFs are optimized for a 62x25mm label.
